# Simple Python Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python.  
It allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. The user is asked to enter two numbers.
2. Then they select an operation by entering a number:
   - `1` for Addition
   - `2` for Subtraction
   - `3` for Division
   - `4` for Multiplication
3. The calculator displays the full equation and result.
4. The process repeats automatically until the user manually stops the program (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl + C`).

ðŸ’¡ Example Output

Enter your first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Choose operation:
1 = Addition
